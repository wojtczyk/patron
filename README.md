# patron

The patronage platform for artists, creators, and free speech on the web3.

## Project Description

patron leverages the synergies of classical web2-based patronage platforms with the key characteristics of the blockchain: anonymity or identity (whichever desired), financial support, immutability of content, non-fungible collectibles, and decentralized architecture.

Why do we need patron? For the ease of use and for the independence of artists and creators!

### Use cases
- Independent artists and creators sharing their work with the world.
- Journalists (even anonymous), yet backable by crypto sharing independent news
- News curators compiling domain specific news from around the world.

patron is an attempt to empower creative individuals to share their work and creations with the world. The goals of the platform are
* Ease of use of blockchain technology
* Anonymous or identified financial backing of artists and creators, anonymous or identified roles for artists and creators
* Decentralized content delivery
* Immutability guarantees that digital content cannot be altered or removed (think of independent journalism)

How do you ensure artists and creators get discovered? A classical portal website will be the interface to the content and work of creators where patrons can customize their feed by up- or downvotes, similar to reddit or hacker news.

## Tools

At this point the project is an idea and was just started from scratch during the EthSF Hackathon based on the *Scaffold-ETH* framework. *Scaffold-ETH* is an incredible starter package to get a project off the ground. As for sponsor technologies, the following uses are planned:

* *TheGraph* for indexing and finding posts, pieces of work, and documents
* *Xmtp* for publishing messages between patrons and creators
* *Push* for notifications of replies, favorites
* *IPFS/Filecoin* to store bigger attachments linked to messages (PDFs, archives, documents)
* *Livepeer* for video attachments and live video chats
* *WorldID* for world-wide verified identification (this is optional, both for patrons and creators)
* *Uniswap* to implement token swaps between creators and their patrons
* *0x* - like uniswap - to implement token swaps between creators and their patrons
* *polygon* to publish work on the network
* *skale* to publish work on the network
